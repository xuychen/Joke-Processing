This text file is used for the record and documentation of the data-cleaning.py.

1. Preprocessing
Because there are some unqualified data, based on how many data it misses, I used different mechanism to fill different blanks. For samples that have too many empty fields, I mark them as unqualified. For samples that have unknown gender, I mark them depending on the result of ¡°gender result¡±. And for others, I take the mode as the data to fill with.

2. Normalization
2.1 Categorical questions
For usual categorical questions, I used one hot encoding to encode the data.
Unlike usual (1, 0) encoding, I flatten the array generated by one hot encoding and divided them into several columns, and change (1, 0) to (1, -1) for normalization to be more accurate.
e.g. column X (Which of the following ethnicities do you most strongly identify with?) is separated into 5 columns (Ethnicity: Black, Ethnicity: Caucasian, Ethnicity: Asian, Ethnicity: Hispanic or Latino, Ethnicity: Middle?Eastern) in the cleaned.csv. depending on True/False, each column will assign 1/-1 respectively to each respondent.
Columns like D-I, J-N, O-S, T, U-AB, AD-AL, AO-AW, AX-BG, BK-BO (in csv file) belong to this type.

2.2 Range numeric questions
2.2.1 Mechanism 
This type of questions is different from usual numeric questions because each sample take a range of number instead of an exact one. So, one of the solutions is to do the label encoding first and then treat it as a numeric question by taking the formula: (x ¨C mean) / std.
Columns like AC, AN, BH, BI, BJ (in csv file) falls into this category.

2.2.2 Mapping
Here is the mapping I use to label the questions:
AC:
{"Below $10,000": 0, "$10,000 - $30,000": 1, "$30,000 - $50,000": 2, "$50,000 - $70,000": 3, "$70,000 - $90,000": 4, "Above $90,000": 5}

AN: 
{"Under 20 years of age": 1, "20 - 30 years of age": 2, "30 - 40 years of age": 3, "40 - 50 years of age": 4, "50 or more years of age": 5}

BH:
{"less than 1 hour": 1, "1-3 hours": 2, "3-4 hours": 3, "4 or more hours": 4}

BI:
{"I do not have children": 0, "1": 1, "2": 2, "More than 2": 3}

BJ:
{"Neither me nor my family owns a vehicle.": 0, "1": 1, "2": 2, "3 or more": 3}
